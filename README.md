# Gomoku
It was part of my Artitfical Intelligence coursework to implement computer move for this game using min max search algorithm with alpha beta pruning.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In terminal (to play this game): 

-java GomokuReferee 

To implement your own player:

-create new class and extend GomokuPlayer class

-override method public Move chooseMove(Color[][] board, Color me)

-Move class has two field row and col (both between 0 and 7) and public contructor Move(int row, int col)

-After code completion compile (javac *.java) and run (java GomokuReferee)
